# Rocky Linux i3 Playbook

## Info 
The setup script and playbook assume you have just booted into a fresh install of a minimal Rocky Linux system. 

The setup script will take care of enabling the EPEL and CRB repositories. It will also install Ansible and run the playbook for you.

## Running the setup script
```
sudo sh setup.sh
```
